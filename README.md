RSA0N11M9A0J_motorised_slider
=============

This project drives a model RSA0N11M9A0J motorised slider using a common L9110 H-Bridge driver.

It also allows using the built in capacitive sensor to prevent the motor from fighting manual movement.

There has three sections, a kicad circuit diagram, an arduino sketch using the capacitive touch library and lastly a few photos of it in action.

The specifications for the slider are available at (http://www.alps.com/WebObjects/catalog.woa/E/HTML/Potentiometer/SlidePotentiometers/RSN1M/RSA0N11M9A0J.html)

Information about using capacitive sensors is available at (http://playground.arduino.cc//Main/CapacitiveSensor)

Improvements and changes cheerfully accepted.
